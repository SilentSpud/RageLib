# RageLib

RageLib is a library for reading and editing the proprietary file formats used by the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE).

Specifically, it is designed to work with the file formats used by Grand Theft Auto IV.

RageLib is part of SparkIV by aru & Ahmed Walid. This repo serves to separate the library from the SparkIV project and make it easier to use in other projects.
